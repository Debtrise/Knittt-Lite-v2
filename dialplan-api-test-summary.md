# Dialplan API Test Results

## Overview
This report summarizes the results of testing the Dialplan API endpoints. The tests were designed to exercise the full lifecycle of dialplan management, from creating projects to generating and deploying dialplans.

## Test Environment
- **API Server**: http://34.122.156.88:3001/api
- **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication
- **Test Date**: April 30, 2025

## Endpoints Tested

### Working Endpoints
The following endpoints are working correctly:

✅ **Project Management**
- `GET /dialplan/projects` - Get all projects
- `GET /dialplan/projects/{id}` - Get project details
- `POST /dialplan/projects` - Create a new project
- `PUT /dialplan/projects/{id}` - Update a project
- `DELETE /dialplan/projects/{id}` - Delete a project
- `POST /dialplan/projects/{id}/clone` - Clone a project

✅ **Context Management**
- `GET /dialplan/projects/{id}/contexts` - Get contexts for a project
- `GET /dialplan/contexts/{id}` - Get context details

✅ **Node Management**
- `GET /dialplan/node-types` - Get available node types
- `GET /dialplan/contexts/{id}/nodes` - Get nodes for a context

✅ **System**
- `GET /system/dialplan-capabilities` - Check dialplan capabilities

### Non-Working Endpoints
The following endpoints encountered issues:

❌ **Node Management**
- `POST /dialplan/contexts/{id}/nodes` - Create a node (Failed to find required node types)

❌ **Connection Management**
- `POST /dialplan/connections` - Create connection (Source node not found)
- `GET /dialplan/contexts/{id}/connections` - Get connections (500 Internal Server Error)

❌ **Dialplan Generation**
- `POST /dialplan/projects/{id}/validate` - Validate a project (404 Not Found)
- `POST /dialplan/projects/{id}/generate` - Generate dialplan (404 Not Found)

## Implementation Notes

1. When creating a project, a default context is automatically created.
2. Node creation was attempted but failed due to issues with node types.
3. Connection creation failed with "Source node not found".
4. The validate and generate endpoints appear to be missing from the API implementation.

## Test Framework
We created a robust test framework that:
1. Tests all dialplan API endpoints
2. Handles authentication with bearer tokens
3. Provides detailed logging of requests and responses
4. Falls back to mock data when the API is unavailable or returns errors

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Node Creation**: Investigate why node creation is failing. It may be related to how node types are defined or how the nodeTypeId is passed.

2. **Implement Connection Management**: Fix the connection endpoints to properly create and retrieve connections between nodes.

3. **Add Validation and Generation Endpoints**: Implement the missing endpoints for validating and generating dialplans.

4. **Add Unit Tests**: Create more focused unit tests for each endpoint with different input scenarios.

5. **API Documentation**: Create comprehensive API documentation with examples and parameter descriptions.

## Conclusion
The Dialplan API provides a solid foundation for managing dialplan projects and contexts. However, further work is needed to fully implement node and connection management, as well as dialplan validation and generation capabilities.

With the mock data fallback system, our test framework allows development to proceed even when the real API is unavailable or incomplete.
